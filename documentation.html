          <p class="bx">
            NOOIR is a collaborative typeface created as part of the design domain project at The Glasgow School of Art. This year's theme is respoisbility.
            Based on a proposal for a reacting font using ligatures to tackle hate speech in communication, NOOIR is free and open-source. Anyone can download 
            it and rework it so it fits their responsible vision of hate speech.
            This platform gives the opportunity to try the font with speech to text feature, discover sample examples and learn how to take part of it!

          <p class="bx">
            This platform features a speech to text tool. It allows you to check if what you said is potentially hatespeech and how it would look like with the NOOIR typeface.
            When landing on the website page, you just have to speak, your speech will be translated into text automatically. (you have to enable and allow access to your microphon first)

        <h3 class="bx">How to use it</h3>
        <p class="bx">
          The idea with this collaborative typeface is to allow anybody to craft and shape the font so it appears responsible and less toxic to the users.
          You can download the typeface and open it in a font editing software to add features and new speech triggers using the ligatures technology.

          You can download the typeface here, and follow this tutorial to create your own version of the font. 
          This version uses the liga features which automatically replaces words with their subsitute. You can also have a version where this is manually done, it is called the dlig feature.
